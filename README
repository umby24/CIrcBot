An IRC Bot written in C++, a project im using to learn C++.

Building
--------
To build, you will need to place libws2_32.a in the source directory. (Not included incase of licensing issues)

I use the CLion IDE, which uses CMake. 

To compile on Windows, if you're using CMake, it should just build and work.

If you're not, you will need to add a linker library for libws2_32.a
